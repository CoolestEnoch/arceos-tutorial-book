* [capability](../crates/capability): Provide basic capability-based security.
* [crate_interface](../crates/crate_interface): Provides a way to define an interface (trait) in a crate, but can implement or use it in any crate. [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/crate_interface)](https://crates.io/crates/crate_interface)
* [driver_block](../crates/driver_block): Common traits and types for block storage drivers.

* [driver_pci](../crates/driver_pci): Structures and functions for PCI bus operations.
* [driver_virtio](../crates/driver_virtio): Wrappers of some devices in the `virtio-drivers` crate, that implement traits in the `driver_common` series crates.
* [flatten_objects](../../crates/flatten_objects): A container that stores numbered objects. Each object can be assigned with a unique ID.
* [handler_table](../crates/handler_table): A lock-free table of event handlers. [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/handler_table)](https://crates.io/crates/handler_table)

* [lazy_init](../crates/lazy_init): A wrapper for lazy initialized values without concurrency safety but more efficient.
* [linked_list](../crates/linked_list): Linked lists that supports arbitrary removal in constant time.

* [percpu_macros](../crates/percpu_macros): Macros to define and access a per-CPU data structure.
* [ratio](../crates/ratio): The type of ratios and related operations.
* [scheduler](../crates/scheduler): Various scheduler algorithms in a unified interface.
* [slab_allocator](../crates/slab_allocator): Slab allocator for `no_std` systems. Uses multiple slabs with blocks of different sizes and a linked list for blocks larger than 4096 bytes.
* [spinlock](../crates/spinlock): `no_std` spin lock implementation that can disable kernel local IRQs or preemption while locking.
* [timer_list](../crates/timer_list): A list of timed events that will be triggered sequentially when the timer expires.
* [tuple_for_each](../crates/tuple_for_each): Provides macros and methods to iterate over the fields of a tuple struct.
